# OneStepAtATime
## Step counter using auto-correlation 

1. This project utilizes Contiki, a microcontroller's accelerometer to measure and record movements. 
2. Next, this data is then processed through the python file.
3. The core of the algorithm is the autoc-orrelation function, which can be used to find the periodicity in a noisy signaland determine if the user is on the bus, walking or stationary.
